# Azure

When you goto host a website, a hosting provider has to provide lots of services to you. like he need to provide ram , bandwidth, hard disk, cpu , softwares and much more. These 
services can be divided into following catagory

	1: Infrastructure services(IAAS): Services like hard disk, firewall, ram, cpu, vm, bandwidth comes into IAAS service or infrastructure service. This layer is the
		metal part of your hosting.
		
	2: Plateform service(PAAS): Services like OS, database, framework like donet, web server like iis apache is called plateform as a service.
	3: Software service(SAAS): Invoicing, yahoo, gmail, Accounting, Control panel etc is comes in SAAS category.

IF you want to do all these by yourself if will be lots of hard work like for hosting you will have to create data center, software license, hardware, cpu, ram, technician,
network guys, hardware engineer etc. By doing all things by itself it will cost too much. Instead we want to pay only we use.
So instead of doing it by ourself we choose a provider like AZURE.

In other word we can say we can pay for ondemand service. 

Cloud follows two principles of O. 
	
		1: Ondemand: for example i want 1 gb ram, 100gb hard disk for 2 days. in future we can increase spce to 500 GB. so we can scale up and down both.
		2: Outsourced: it says customer dont need to worry about db backup. he can focus on his website or his business rest is taken care by service provider.
It is same like we go to hotel place a order and eat food. we dont want to worry about how food is being cooked, how staff will clean plates after eating. we just pay
only for what we used.

So in cloud also service provider gives flexibility to its customer to use its layer as a service and pay only for they want to use.
